## Motivation
* Damn, I have to write an exposé. Well at least I have already written one, but after a year the whole structure and concepts require some updates.
* First lets do some research

## First steps

* The first read already shows, that there are no "strict" guidelines and I have to find my own style. I should define some features I want to have.
* After reading the some more documents, the article should contain examples on how to not write specific paragraphs. Also there is no guide for one exposé, the structure and size are predetermined by the overall workload of the project. A homework exposé should only have ~2 pages while the phd proposal should have at least 5.
* a very important part is the actual time in the process, when to write an exposé. Although it is supposed to be the first real document, its creation is preceded by information gathring and domain discovery
